## Dependecies
- PyTorch version >= 1.0.0
- Python version >= 3.6

## Downloads
- Download CoNLL-2014 evaluation scripts

```
cd gec_scripts/
sh download.sh
```

- Download **pre-processed data** & **pre-trained models**
  
  pre-trained model: (Google Drive/Baidu Pan) 
    - url1: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zewifHUUwvqc2F-MfDRsZFio6PlSzx2c/view?usp=sharing
    - url2: https://pan.baidu.com/s/1hCwQeNFjng_0_NiViJq6fg (code: mxrf)
    
  pre-processed data: (Google Drive)(train/valid/test)
    - url: https://drive.google.com/open?id=17s-TZiM6ilQ-SHklxTUun2Jdgg8B9zS3  

## Train with the pre-trained model
```
cd fairseq-gec
pip install --editable .
sh train.sh \${device_id} \${experiment_name}
```

## Train without the pre-trained model
Modify train.sh to train without the pre-trained model

- delete parameter "--pretrained-model" 
- change the value of "--max-epoch" to 15 (more epochs are needed without pre-trained parameters) 

## Evaluate on the CoNLL-2014 test dataset
```
sh g.sh \${device_id} \${experiment_name}
```

## Get pre-trained models from scratch
We have public our pre-trained models as mentioned in the downloads part. We list the steps here, in case someone want to get the pre-trained models from scratch. 

```
1. # prepare target sentences using one billion benchmark dataset
2. sh noise.sh # generate the noised source sentences 
3. sh preprocess_noise_data.sh # preprocess data
4. sh pretrain.sh 0,1 _pretrain # pretrain 
```
